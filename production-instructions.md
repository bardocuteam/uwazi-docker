# Use of Uwazi production enviroment

## With uwazi-docker
> Warning: [uwazi-docker](https://github.com/fititnt/uwazi-docker) can make it
easy for someone unskilled test [Uwazi](https://www.uwazi.io/) and, at best,
in hands with someone with a knowledge of docker/databases and free time, be a
reference base to use for a small deployment. If you or team do not have
knowledge and/or time, consider official support and hosting from
<https://www.uwazi.io/>.

**Uwazi-docker is not designed to run in production.**

Did you have extra tips or improvements that could make uwazi-docker a bit more
friendly to run on production but still be able to be tested for unskilled
people? If you are willing to release your collaboration under public domain,
you can submit suggestions in <https://github.com/fititnt/uwazi-docker/issues>.
