# Use of Uwazi production enviroment
> Disclaimer: [uwazi-docker](https://github.com/fititnt/uwazi-docker) can make it
easy for someone unskilled test [Uwazi](https://www.uwazi.io/) and, at best,
in hands with someone with a knowledge of docker/databases and free time, be a
reference base to use for a small deployment **at your own risk**. The Uwazi
itself (the software, without the full stack with Mongodb and ElasticSearch on
this dockerized version) are production-ready, safe to use on your organization.
If you or team do not have knowledge and/or time, consider official support and
hosting from <https://www.uwazi.io/>.

## With uwazi-docker

In short: **uwazi-docker is not designed to run in production**. If in the
future enough volunteers with both experience and usage on production
environment feel more confident, this status could change.

_Did you have extra tips or improvements that could make uwazi-docker a bit more
friendly to run on production but still be able to be tested for unskilled
people? If you are willing to release your collaboration under public domain,
you can submit suggestions in <https://github.com/fititnt/uwazi-docker/issues>._

## On your server (Uwazi oficial documentation)
